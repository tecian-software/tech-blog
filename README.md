# Tecian Tech Blog

All the material and source code making up the tecian tech blog is stored in this repo. The `posts` directory contains a series of sub-directories organized by post date. Each directory has a `post.md` file containing the actual post, along with a `source-code` directory containing any sample code (terraform, python etc).
